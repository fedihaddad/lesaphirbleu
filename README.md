# Restaurant Card Prototype

This is a small prototype using Vite + React + Tailwind CSS that demonstrates an improved UI/UX for a restaurant "link-in-bio" style card (inspired by your screenshot).

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Notes:
- Images are simple placeholders in `public/assets`.
- The prototype focuses on responsive layout, accessible buttons, and polished visuals.
